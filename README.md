found myself what i truly want
or did i, can never be sure 

of what is clear
never sure what the passing sand will bring
feeling's here
still the same

what a nice thing to see

yeah

i can feel it coming on and on
coming on and on
on and on
on and on
eyyyyaau

on and on (deep voice) 

going alone

going alone
falling in time
falling in line
can it be now
eyyy-yaa-aa

(sample)
wake up
feel that you love me
wake up 
feel that i love you

on and on (deep) / yeah

i can feel it coming on and on
coming on and on
on and on
on and on
eyyyyaau

on and on (deep voice) 

going alone

going alone
falling in time
falling in line
can it be now
eyyy-yaa-aa

what i truly want is here
can never be so sure -  
never sure
what the passing sand will bring
feeling's here feeling's here
still the same eyeyeyeyeyea

deep voice
feeling's here
still the same

eyaaa-aaa-u

on and on
